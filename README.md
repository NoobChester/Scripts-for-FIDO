# Scripts-for-FIDO
# 1. Skip FIDO login
Skips the annoying FIDO login page by auto-clicking "login" (needs auto-fill to be active)

MUST HAVE autofill activated!

Requires a scriploader, I recommend Tampermonkey

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey

1.2: Added a slight delay which helps with the script loading before autofill does its job.

1.3: added loop for better speed and stability.

You could now replace your student image with an image or gif too! https://noobchester.github.io/Scripts-for-FIDO/

# 2. Dark FIDO

Dark mode for FIDO

Use the Stylus extension to load this
