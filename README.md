# 1. Skip FIDO login (obsolete)

**(Logins can be saved in cookies now as a native feature, making this script obsolete.**

Skips the annoying FIDO login page by auto-clicking "login" (needs auto-fill to be active)

MUST HAVE autofill activated!

Requires a scriploader, I recommend Tampermonkey

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey

1.2: Added a slight delay which helps with the script loading before autofill does its job.

1.3: added loop for better speed and stability.

# 2. Dark FIDO

Dark mode for FIDO

Use the Stylus extension to load this

Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us/

Opera: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/stylus/

1.3: Great visual improvement!

1.3.1: Removes white stripe below the name list

1.3.2: Better visibility for some words

1.3.3  .4  .5: Patch for new fido update

You could now replace your student image with an image or gif too! https://noobchester.github.io/Scripts-for-FIDO/

# 3. FIDO Clock
Adds a clock to FIDO

Updates everytime the page is loading, helps reduce the chance of you misunderstanding the deadlines due to them not being updated to the current time.

Needs a scriptloader too, see "1. Skip FIDO login (obsolete)"
